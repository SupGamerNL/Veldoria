      <h2>⚙️ Development Status</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Veldoria</strong> is currently in a <em>very early stage of development</em>.  
        Most maps, systems, and story mechanics are still being designed and tested.

        Maps, interiors, and key story points are slowly being built using RPG Maker MZ’s default RTP.
