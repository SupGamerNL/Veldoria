# The Story of Veldoria – RPG MZ  

Welcome to **The Story of Veldoria**, an immersive RPG experience built with RPG Maker MZ. Step into a world where elemental magic breathes life into the land, memories shape destiny, and every choice could unveil the secrets of the past.  

## 🌍 About the Game  
In the land of **Veldoria**, steam-driven machines hum beside ancient magic, and peace is always fragile. Two childhood friends, Kaelen and Morgan, once shared dreams of greatness — one chosen to be the hero, the other left behind. Now, as darkness rises again, Morgan must navigate lost memories and reclaim the truth.  

Your journey is not only to fight monsters and dungeons but to uncover the mysteries hidden in time, essence, and memory.
