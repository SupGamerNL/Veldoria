Set in a world where *magic and machinery intertwine*, the game follows two childhood friends—**Kaelen Markurnium** and **Morgan Tiaturnus**—whose fates once walked side by side... until destiny tore them apart.

## 🌍 The World of Veldoria

A world shaped by **Essence**, the primal energy that fuels life, technology, and magic itself.  
Every being, structure, and storm carries its own elemental resonance.  

### 🔹 The Seven Primal Elements
| Element | Domain | Traits |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Neutral** | Base essence of existence | Found in all things |
| **Earth** | Stone, minerals, mountains | Strength, defense |
| **Fire** | Heat, passion, destruction | Power, transformation |
| **Grass** | Nature, growth, healing | Life, fertility |
| **Frost** | Ice, stillness, control | Preservation, precision |
| **Thunder** | Storms, kinetic force | Energy, movement |
| **Water** | Flow, purity, adaptability | Healing, renewal |

### 🔸 The Dual Forces
- **Lumen (Light)** – Guidance, purity, celestial truth  
- **Umbra (Shadow)** – Mystery, chaos, and hidden emotion  

When primal and divine essences fuse, **new hybrid elements** emerge — from **Verdix**, the pulse of overgrowth, to **Celestine**, the astral radiance of stars themselves.

## 🏞️ Settlements

### **Draevenholt**
A quiet forest village, home to about 20 souls.  
It houses:
- 🏠 *Inn & Tavern*  
- ⚙️ *Accessory Shop*  
- 🔨 *Blacksmith*  
- 📦 *General Store*  

It is from here that **Morgan’s story begins**, surrounded by whispers of the forest and memories that do not belong to him…

## 🏛️ The Dungeons of Veldoria

### **Temple of the Forgotten Bough**
Hidden within the Draevenwood Forest lies a temple swallowed by roots and time.  
Within it sleeps *the Great Tree*—and the truth of Morgan’s past.  
The temple is more than a dungeon… it is a *test of memory*.  
Fail, and the shadows of the past remain forever sealed.
